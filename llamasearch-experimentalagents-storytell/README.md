## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourorg/data-storytelling-framework.git
cd data-storytelling-framework

# (Recommended) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start (Python API)

```python
import pandas as pd
from llamasearch_experimentalagents_storytell.core.engine import StorytellingEngine

# Prepare your data (as DataFrame, dict, or file path)
data = pd.read_csv("sales_data.csv")

# Initialize the engine (set your OpenAI API key via env or argument)
engine = StorytellingEngine(openai_api_key="sk-...your-key...")

# Run the full pipeline
result = engine.run_pipeline(
    data=data,
    output_dir="./output",
    output_format="html",
    context="Monthly sales and marketing performance for Q2 2024. Highlight key drivers and risks.",
    title="Q2 2024 Sales & Marketing Executive Summary"
)

print(f"Narrative: {result['narrative'].summary}")
print(f"Dashboard: {result['dashboard_path']}")
```

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Command-Line Usage

```bash
python -m llamasearch_experimentalagents_storytell.cli \
  --data ./data/sales_data.csv \
  --output-dir ./output \
  --api-key sk-...your-key... \
  --title "Q2 2024 Sales & Marketing Executive Summary" \
  --context "Monthly sales and marketing performance for Q2 2024. Highlight key drivers and risks."
```

- Outputs: `narrative.json`, `dashboard.html`, and all visualizations in `./output`.
- Use `--narrative-only` to skip visualizations and dashboard.

---

## üìä What You Get

- **NarrativeSummary**: Executive summary, key insights, recommendations, and full narrative text (JSON/Markdown).
- **Visualizations**: Interactive charts (attribution, experiment results, performance metrics, and more).
- **Dashboard**: A single HTML file combining narrative and visuals, ready for executives or clients.

---

## üß© Extending the Framework

- **Add new chart types**: Subclass or extend `VisualizationEngine`.
- **Plug in your own LLM**: Swap out the agent in `StorytellingEngine`.
- **Custom business logic**: Add new methods or hooks for your domain.
- **Configuration**: Use `.env`, environment variables, or JSON config files for all settings.

## üìù Example: E-commerce Executive Dashboard

```python
from llamasearch_experimentalagents_storytell.core.engine import StorytellingEngine
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv("ecommerce_q2_2024.csv")
engine = StorytellingEngine(openai_api_key="sk-...your-key...")
result = engine.run_pipeline(
    data=data,
    output_dir="./output",
    title="Q2 2024 E-commerce Executive Dashboard",
    context="Summarize key drivers of revenue, conversion, and customer growth."
)
print(result['dashboard_path'])
```

---

## üîí Security & Privacy
- Your data is processed locally; only the narrative generation step (if using OpenAI) sends data to the LLM API.
- You control what data is sent and can use mock agents for sensitive data.
